# {{title}}

Hi, I'm Oscar. Online I go by Oscarno. I live in Brisbane, Australia (the best city in the wolrd). I'm currently pursuing a life composing and sound designing for video games. You can always check the [now](/now) page for deets on what I'm working on currently.

This website is a place for me to chuck a record of all the stuff I've done, and write reflections and recaps (mostly for my own reference later). Thanks for stopping by.

// elsewhere:
- My professional work is done under [Memory Card Audio](https://memorycardaudio.com)
- I sometimes use [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/oscarno.bsky.social)
- Occasionally I will livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/oscarno_)
- My games can be found on [itch.io](https://oscarno.itch.io/)
</br></br>

// why this website

I find making a space for myself on the net very empowering and exciting. It also helps me focus my time and energy into getting things finished so I can share them here. I also enjoy having a central place I can look back on and see a time capsule of stuff from long ago :)
